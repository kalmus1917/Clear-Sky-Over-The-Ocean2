 POLITICS_VICKY_I_DESC:0 "Princess Victoria Louise Adelaide Matilda Charlotte Von Hohenzollern of Prussia, the daughter of Kaiser Wilhelm, the third to bear the name
Victoria' after her grandmother, German Empress Victoria, and her great-grandmother Queen Victoria. One of the least expected people of the Kaiser’s seven children to take over the throne of the Kaiserreich. However after her father and most of her family died in a terrible car accident. Now she has become Kaiserin Victoria I. Of Her Name, German Empress, by the Grace of God, Mother of the Reichspakt, Queen of Prussia, Margravine of Brandenburg, Sovereign and Supreme Duke of Silesia, Grand Duchess of the Lower Rhine and Posen, Duchess consort of Brunswick, Duchess of Saxony, Westphalia and Pomerania, of Lüneburg and Bremen, of Holstein, Schleswig and Lauenburg, Burgravine of Nuremberg, Landgrave of Hesse, Princess of East Frisia, Osnabrück and Hildesheim, of Nassau and Fulda, Countess of Hohenzollern, Lady of Frankfurt. She has always been popular with the people and she had always been the favorite child of the Kaiser. This has to due with her beauty and her populist attitude towards politics. Strangely she had always publicly mentioned wishing to be in alliance with the Entente and to heal old wounds with them over the Weltkrieg. Even though she is loved by many, there are elements from both the left and the right who see her as a threat to their plans. All this combined with the fact her reign has begun with the end of a Golden Age for Germany, the death of the Kaiser, and the worst global economic crisis in history. She will have alot of work to do to fix the Fatherland and bring the a bright future to Germany."
