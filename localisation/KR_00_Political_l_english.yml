### Subtype Descriptions ###
totalist_subtype_desc:0 "The term Totalism comes from the Totalist Charter, an agreement of cooperation between Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois and Benito Mussolini which outlined the main tenets of the ideology. Totalists abandon the federative element of Syndicalist state organization, stating that until world revolution has been achieved, revolutionary states need to be centralized and militarized to fight the remaining capitalist states. The extent to which society is transformed by Totalist regimes is significantly greater as well, often veering to totalitarian control of society and the construction of personality cults. Totalism is also often used to describe left-wing states which are not affiliated with Charter Totalism, but nevertheless display traits such as militarization, centralization, and totalitarian transformation of society."
syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Syndicalism is the leading left-wing revolutionary ideology whose rise to worldwide prominence began with the French revolution of 1919. Though Syndicalism is divided between various currents, some of them influenced by other ideologies such as Marxism and Anarchism, orthodox Syndicalism is based upon the works of the leaders of Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT), codified in the Charter of Amiens of 1906, and considers Mikhail Bakunin and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon to be its forerunners. Syndicalism is defined by the concepts of revolutionary spontaneity and direct action - the belief that the workers themselves, organized in labour unions, must combat capitalism, instead of relying upon an external agent such as a political party. The transformation of a capitalist society to a Syndicalist one must occur via a General Strike - a nationwide rejection of capitalism and a transfer of all means of production to labour unions. Syndicalist states are decentralized and federal, all industries are organized into syndicates, labour councils elected from these trade unions manage local governance, and central government is vested in a national congress of trade union representatives. The extent to which these tenets are implemented varies from country to country, however."
radical_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Radical Socialism is a catch-all phrase for the various Socialist, Communist and Anarchist ideologies that aren't directly associated with Syndicalism. Countries with this ideology operate with a socialist economy, usually accompanied with some kind of elected form of government; Their ultimate goal is to create a paradise for the working class, the details of which varies from movement to movement."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is an ideology whose goal is to reform capitalism and humanise it by aligning it with the ethical ideals of social welfare while maintaining the capitalist mode of production, rather than creating an alternative socialist economic system. While usually promoting a plutocratic form of government and a heavily regulated market economy, some more radical streams exist."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Social liberalism is a variation on mainstream Market liberalism, with the main difference being the inclusion of various civil freedoms as basic human rights. Professing progressive social and economic policies the social liberals aim to create a society where every individual is free to live his own life with full opportunities regardless of their status."
market_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "Market liberals see themselves as the mainstream liberal ideology. The main tenants of market liberalism are an unregulated free market and a democratic plutocratic political system. Market liberals believe that the freer the market the freer the people, and they will staunchly defend the political and economic rights of the individual."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Conservatism is a political ideology centred on preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy as well as the traditional power dynamic of society while using the democratic system. Opposed to both radical and moderate changes to the status quo, conservatives want to keep society in order and stable. Usually they promote a regulated market economy, but more liberal economic policies aren't unheard of."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Authoritarian democracy is an ideology that combines a strong executive power with a representative parliament and a partial democratic political system. Authoritarian democratic regimes often take a conservative stance on social issues and promote liberal-capitalist economies with limited state intervention. The aim of these regimes are to maintain national stability and provide the people both a popular and responsible government."
paternal_autocrat_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a monarch or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the righteous and best path while uniting the people under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporate economy. Often espousing racial politics and violent rhetoric, National Populism is vehemently opposed by most other political parties."

nasserism_subtype:0 "Nasserist Pan-Arabism"
nasserism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Nasserist Pan-Arabism)§!\n\nUnique ideology developed by Gamal Abdel Nasser, Nasserist Pan-Arabism is combination of Totalism, Pan-Arabism and Arab Socialism. Combining Arab nationalism with radical anti-colonialism, state ownership of public utilities and natural resources, state control over the trade, and workers representation in profit-sharing. All of that system is protected by one party - an Arab party, that protects all people across the land it governs."
natsynd_subtype:0 "National Syndicalism"
natsynd_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Syndicalism)§!\n\nOftentimes referred to as Charter Totalism or even just Totalism, National Syndicalism describes an ideology that seeks to centralize the usually decentralized Syndicalist system around a strong central executive or authoritative body while supported by Nationalist tendencies. Pioneered by the likes of Oswald Mosley, Georges Valois, and Benito Mussolini, among other signers of the Totalist Charter, this new form of authoritarian Syndicalism seeks to safeguard the Revolution through any means necessary without allowing the weak and disorganized nature of decentralized government becoming an obstacle to national progress."
authcom_subtype:0 "Communism"
authcom_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Communism)§!\n\nThe term 'Communism' is usually used to designate one of the main alternatives to orthodox French and English Syndicalism. Based on the writings and thoughts of Marx, Engels and Lenin, the ideology promotes revolution as a means of seizing power led by a vanguard party operating on the principles of democratic centralism composed of professional revolutionaries, representing both workers and peasants, who would establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, a phase of Socialism serving as a transition from the Capitalist bourgeois society to the ideal classless and stateless society: the communist society. During this phase of Socialism the means of production would be transferred from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. The tendencies within the Leninist current may differ, but all Communists are united in their struggle for a better world for the proletariat of the whole world."
sorelianism_subtype:0 "Sorelianism"
sorelianism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Sorelianism)§!\n\nComposed on the teachings and writings of French Revolutionary Georges Sorel, Sorelianism seeks the creation of a deeply centralized National Worker's State with the framework of Revolutionary Syndicalism. While seemingly highly contradictory, Sorelianism is one of the more popular forms of national syndicalism within post-Revolution Western Europe, making it's viability as a sustainable ideology quite good."

Caponeism is based around the idea of ‘Mobster Populism’, or a system in which a criminal network fulfills the role of the State in a Leftist-inspired welfare society. While not outwardly Socialist, this barely-cohesive ideology shares some similarities with French Illegalism, along with the idea many Leftists hold that it is the State’s role to take care of and meet the needs of the people in a fair environment, only with the State in these societies being the outfits, organizations, and syndicates of their criminal overlords. Authoritarian and paternalistic under the absorbed hierarchies of the crime syndicate that formed it, Caponeist societies still feature local democracies both tied to and free from the operations of the criminals around them while also supporting local unions and workers organizations both for the betterment of the working class and to profit off their work. Gaining more popularity as figures such as Lucky Luciano and Casper Holstein begin to spread these thoughts, Caponeism is slowly evolving into a more coherent and legitimate ideology with each passing day."

Germanic Socialism therefore promotes the unity of the German people within a single Pan-Germanic state, united by the central figure of the 'Volkskanzler', guardian of the Germanic Tradition and of the People's Empire. The economy of the German Socialist state is organized in a corporatist manner, with national industries and private enterprises working hand in hand.

Usually radical and fiercely devoted to its Pan-African and Futurist goals bordering on millenarianism or zealotry, these groups will stop at nothing to achieve the Afrofuture."

klan_nationalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Klan Nationalism)§!\n\nKlan Nationalism is a generic name of the White Supremacist ideology esposed by the American Ku Klux Klan. Varied in its approach to how it handles issues concerning race and ethnicity, the varied sects of the Klan all agree on one thing - White is right. From supporting Back to Africa plans to advocating to a total return the slavery, the ideas of the Klan are varied and diverse, but they can all agree that piety, nationalism, white supremacism, American exceptionalism, and militarism are all Godly pursuits."

goering_loyalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Göringist Nationalism)§!\n\nGöringist Nationalism, rarely called Göringism or Göring Loyalism, is the loose and ill-defined term for Hermann Göring’s own personal ideology. Espousing ideas of German Supremacism, Militarism, Nationalism, Kleptocratic practices, institutionalized corruption, bastardized monarchism, and hedonism, this decadent thoughtform ties together all the aspects of Göring’s twisted and self-indulgent personality form fitted to fit his personal fiefdom. As he sets himself up as a faux monarch in Africa, others around the world look to his image and copy his methods as they seek to build their own fiefdoms as well."
townerism_subtype:0 "Townerism"
townerism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Townerism)§!\n\nTownerism, more generally called Amerindian Revivalism or Nativist Nationalism, is a unique and non-uniform group of ideologies pioneered by the likes of Elwood Towner, Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco, and Francisco May Pech, among other Nationalists within the diverse Native American population. Espousing Anti-White and Anti-Western sentiments, this Nationalist, Militarist, Corporatist, and highly Xenophobic ideology varies, either calling for syncretic unity between all Native American groups in order to bolster the decaying culture of the First Peoples from the corruptive and corrosive influence of the White Devils, or merely revivalism of one specific Amerindian or Mesoamerican identity. Populist by nature and concerned with ecological and spiritual matters while being anti-Clerical towards standard, Western, non-Indigenous faiths, this unique grouping of ideologies seeks to undo the damage the ‘White Man’ has wrought upon the Americas while either uniting or singularly uplifting their chosen Amerinidian ethnic group above all other lesser races and cultures."

right_syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Right Syndicalism)§!\n\nRight Syndicalism, encompassing ideas from Reactionary National Syndicalism, Synarchism, Falangism, and various other smaller movements, seeks to incorporate Syndicalist economics with Corporatist and Nationalist attitudes in an inherently anti-Socialist system. Popularized particularly within Latin America and Iberia, as well as minorly in Italy and France, Right Syndicalism pursues a ‘purified’ and populist form of Syndicalism usually based around nationalist, ethnicity, or race, and is frequently militarist in its outlook."

national_basedism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Basedism)§!\n\nYou like Huey Lewis and the News? Their early work was a little too New Wave for my  taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello but I think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is 'Hip To Be Square,' a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's a a personal statement about the band itself."

natpop_right_panafricanism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Right Pan-Africanism)§!\n\nRight Pan-Africanism, sometimes penned as Pan-Afrikanism, Panafrikanism, or Panafrianism, describes a diverse group of ideas and movements all centered around the idea of Pan-African unity. Oftentimes including the African Diaspora as well as just the African continent, this fiercely Nationalist and varyingly Populist ideology usually seeks to promote either total political and even cultural unity between African groups under an array of Leftist ideas, or just cooperation and comradery between ethnic groups each promoting their unique identities in their own ethnonationalist states. Though not inherently, Right Pan-Africanism is frequently militaristic and sometimes even monarchist when not a national dictatorship, a junta, or a republic, and is commonly either corporatist, capitalist, or traditionalist in its economic goals with varying degrees of authoritarianism, though some democratic do exist. Widespread across much of Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, it has been pioneered by figures such as Marcus Garvey, Stanley Mathenge, Nnamdi Azikiwe, and many others, and is one of the fastest growing new ideologies on Earth."

natpop_kimbanguism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Kimbanguism)§!\n\nNgunzism, often just called Kimbanguism, is as much a faith as it is an ideology. Inherently linked to the Prophet Kimbangu’s pacifistic and populist Protestant message and the belief that the Christian faith started in the Congo and that Kimbangu himself is the Holy Spirit, Ngunzism forms the foundations of Kimbangu’s spiritual eden. Linked with nationalist groups, it has come to fully embrace Congolese Nationalism and Exceptionalism along with Corporatist economics while becoming even more radically anti-Imperialist, though it has retained its pacifistic stance despite opposition."
ariosophy_subtype:0 "Ariosophy"
ariosophy_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Ariosophy)§!\n\nMeaning ‘Wisdom of the Aryans,’ Ariosophy - also called Armanism - is the brainchild of Lanz von Liebenfels and his predecessor Guido von List which uplifts the Austrians and the rest of the so-called Aryan race as the pinnacle of humanity. Describing other races are ape-men and lowly beasts, only the Aryans are the true sons of the ancient god-beings that birthed us, and though careful adherence to von Liebenfels’ teachings, the Aryans can reattain their divine powers and status, or that is the hope. Deeply tied to Germanic paganism and romanticism while being unapologetically supremacist, seeing all other forms of humanity as subhuman wastrels, Ariosophy seeks to uplift the one, chosen race to utopia while leaving all others behind in the mud or beneath it."
volkism_subtype:0 "Völkism"
volkism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Völkism)§!\n\nVölkism, sometimes erroneously dubbed as Folkism or Valkism outside the Germanic Sphere, describes a loosely connected group of Germanic ultranationalist schools of thought that strive for racial purity, national unity, martial strength, and sometimes - but not always - devout piety. Though sometimes Atheistic and very rarely pagan, a large majority of Völkist groups are Nordicist or Neo-Marcionite in faith, and all are guardians of tradition and the ways of their old ancestors and older gods. Utilizing a range of Corporatist to near-anarchist economic theories depending on the specific band, this ideology is as varied and disorganized as it is enduring and infectious, with its rhetoric of Blood and Soil ringing true with the hearts and minds of many disillusioned Germanics."

From the traditionalist and aristocratic but liberal and progressive ideas of Kalergi to the hypernationalist, esoteric, and anti-modern rhetoric of Evola, this ideology comes in many variations and breeds. Above all, however, they are usually nationalist - either through the creation of a new Pan-European identity or through the uplifting of one or more specific ethnicities - and seek to unify Europe so as to protect the continent from outside influences while working towards the prosperity of all those deemed worthy within."
national_radicalism_subtype:0 "National Radicalism"
national_radicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(National Radicalism)§!\n\nA byproduct of the younger generation of Endecja members becoming politically active, National Radicalism is the more fervent form of National Democracy, taking the Polish National Thought to its extremes. To the young radicals, a unified Polish nation is a Catholic nation and any notion of atheism or agnosticism professed by old Endecja is scoffed at. When it comes to a vision for a government system they are also more radical, advocating for highly hierarchical or even outright totalitarian forms, run by a lifelong senate, one leader or an enlightened council. National Radicals also don't try to hide their disdain for most ethnic minorities inside Poland's borders, although some dream of creating a Pan-Slavic hallowed empire. Radicals are also somehow even more divided on the matter of the economy than mainline Endecja, supporting everything from corporativism, right syndicalism, distributism and ending up on a neo-feudalist guild system. If there is one clear thing about National Radicals, it's certainly that they are even more controversial and less politically defined than their progenitor Dmowski."

mathengeism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Mathengeism)§!\n\nThe ideology of Stanley Mathenge is hard to truly describe, for it is Pan-Afrikan and occultist like its predecessor of true Maumausim, but has evolved into so much more. Called a variety of things from Bantu Supremacism and Pan-Afrikan Kikuyu Chauvinism to Nationalist Maumauism or even simply ‘Mathengeism’, this creed espouses pure self-reliance, autarky, anti-Westernism and anti-Europeanism, Bantu exceptionalism, Kikuyu-Kenyan nationalism, vaguely National Syndicalist economics in a traditionalist tribal structure, and complete loyalty and subservience to the state and to Mathenge himself. Pushing to unite the lands of all true children of the Bantu - encompassing roughly 2/3rds of the African continent - and seeking to eradicate or enslave any soul not of Bantu blood, Mathengeism is as bloody as it is determined to see this dream to the end. Highly militarized and totalitarian in the extreme while supported by the traditional and occult practices of both the Kikuyu peoples and the ritualistic Mau-Mau, Mathengeism seeks to bath Africa in blood in order to usher in the first true and united Bantu empire."

First coming to prominence during the 'Mrs. Clause' Crisis of Santa 265's tenor as St. Nick, Toy Santaism was eventually thrown out of power after Santa 265 successfully stopped Toy Santa from delivering coal to all the naughty children of the world. Policy wise, Toy Santaism actually deveiates very little from Santaism proper, with one exception. Instead of having mercy and understanding that children can do a few naughty things but still be nice at heart, Toy Santaism views even one naughty act as deserving of coal, or worse. While the majority of the world will receive coal according to the adherents of Toy Santa, a few do still get toys, but these special few are quite literally walking Saints, and are more the expectation than the norm."

Created by Anastasy Vonsiatsky with the formation of the All-Russian National-Revolutionary Labour Worker-Peasant Party of Nationalists, the Natsionalisty provided a paramilitary backbone to the Kolchak regime in form of the so-called Black Vanguard. Sharing some elements with Kazem-Bek's group, such as fervent nationalism and monarchist tendencies, National Restorationists denounce any form Bolshevism or Socialism as the 'Great Soviet Demon' corrupting the souls of Russia. Surprisingly to many, Vonsiatsky also puts a heavy emphasis on the preservation of nature and protection of animals, especially the Chinese softshell turtle, known as 'Far-Eastern turtle' to the locals of Vladivostok."
